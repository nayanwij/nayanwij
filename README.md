# 👋 Hi, I’m Nayantara. 
I answer to 'nayan' or 'tara' but never 'naya'which is 🐍 in my native language. 

### I am working on dengue transmission dynamics in Sri Lanka using surveillance data. I am interested in modelling anything vector borne, especially, dengue and malaria. 

🌱 Fascinated by viruses and viral evolution, systems biology approaches to understand viral pathogenesis, genetic epidemiology, genomic surveillance strategies, and spatial modelling.

🌱 I’m currently implementing RStan, perusing Python, and love using GitHub to share reproducible research.
  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects.
