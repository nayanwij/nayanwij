- 👋 Hi, I’m nayantara.  I answer to 'nayan' or 'tara' but never 'naya'🐍. 
- 👀 I’m working on dengue transmission dynamics and interested in modelling anything vector borne, especially, dengue and malaria and fascinated by viruses and genetic epidemiology studies and genomic surveillance and spatial modelling.
- 🌱 I’m currently implementing RStan, learning Python, and working at efficiently using GitHub to share reproducible research.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects.
